# metro_station_ticket_booking
I am Just Trying to make a simple Metro station ticket booking app, i which you can select source location and destination and calculate the fare and book ticket
<br> <br>
now i have added feature for user to select Source and Destination And on that basis he will get Fare calculation for booking his ticket
<br> <br>
now i am addin a new Feature of Wallet in which user can see there money and can add the money buy recharging into there wallet
<br> <br>
now i am adding new feature as a list of Available Station and Fares so that user can decide easily
